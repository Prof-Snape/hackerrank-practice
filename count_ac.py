# There are 1010 problems in a contest. You know that the score of each problem is either 11 or 100100 points.

# Chef came to know the total score of a participant and he is wondering how many problems were actually solved by
# that participant.
#
# Given the total score PP of the participant, determine the number of problems solved by the participant. Print -1âˆ’1
# in case the score is invalid.
